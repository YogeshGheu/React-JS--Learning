# React JS Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress and experiments while learning React.js:

1. Created a basic React app using the **Vite bundler** for a fast development experience:  
   - Commands used:  
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

2. Built a mini version of React to understand how it works behind the scenes:  
   - Used plain HTML and JavaScript to create custom methods.  
   - Injected the script into an HTML page to simulate React functionality.  

3. Learned how the `useState` hook works by creating a simple counter application:  
   - Added two buttons to increase and decrease a value.  
   - Implemented logic to ensure the value stays within the range of 0 to 20.  

4. Explored how to pass props to components and render them dynamically:  
   - Embedded Tailwind CSS into the project for styling.  
   - Followed Tailwind's documentation under **Framework Guides > Vite** for integration.  

5. Created a mini background color changer project:  
   - Used an array of colors and the `.map()` function to generate buttons dynamically.  
   - Clicking a button updates the background color of the page.  

6. Built a Password Generator Application:
   - Learned how to use `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` hooks to manage and optimize state and side effects.
   - Created a function to dynamically generate random passwords based on user preferences (length, numbers, special characters).
   - Used the `useRef` hook to interact with the DOM for copying the generated password to the clipboard.
   - Added an interactive slider to adjust the password length and checkboxes to toggle the inclusion of numbers and special characters.
   - Improved UI using Tailwind CSS, focusing on responsiveness and styling.
